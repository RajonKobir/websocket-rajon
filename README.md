# A RealTime Chat Application using Node, Express, socket.io. Deployed at Heroku!!!

Use Multiple Browsers or users visited at a time. Then they'll be able to chat each other!
No chat rooms yet, I'm working on it...
No database attached, so don't refresh the page, unless old chat messages will be gone!!!


# Instructions

Download this repository and run command "npm install" for installing all the dependencies.

Then write "node app" or "nodemon app" to run the app. It will be listened to localhost:4000
